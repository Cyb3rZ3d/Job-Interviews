# Behavioral Questions:


> 1. Tell me about a time you made a mistake. How did you handle it?”

Example Answer (STIG/PPSM-based):

"While working on a PPSM request for the Defense Health Agency, I mistakenly listed an incorrect port number for a system that was under review. The mistake was caught during peer review.
I took immediate responsibility, corrected the documentation, and reviewed the DISA STIGs and service requirements more carefully moving forward. I also created a checklist template to avoid future input errors.

The issue was resolved without impact, and the change I implemented helped improve accuracy across the team’s submissions."


> 2. Describe a time when you had to learn a new tool or system quickly.”

Example Answer (Hack The Box / ELK Stack):

During my CSEC 5350 course, I was tasked with building a functioning SOC environment using the ELK Stack. At the time, I had never configured Elasticsearch or Kibana before.

I committed to learning the stack through documentation, online labs, and tutorials. I built a test environment, deployed rsyslog forwarding from my Kali and Ubuntu instances, and successfully visualized attack logs from a simulated Apache RCE.

This experience gave me the confidence to pick up new tools quickly, and now ELK is one of my strongest areas.


> 3. Tell me about a time you had to work under pressure.

Example Answer (Navy-based):

While deployed in the U.S. Navy as an Aviation Machinist Mate, one of our F/A-18s had a powerplant vibration issue shortly before a scheduled mission.

Our team had to diagnose the issue quickly, under stress and time pressure. I led the teardown and reassembly of the turbine components, coordinated with Quality Assurance, and we cleared the aircraft safely and on time.

That experience taught me how to remain calm, follow procedures, and prioritize safety under pressure — lessons I carry with me into security incident response.


> 4.  Tell me about a time you had to explain a technical concept to a non-technical person.”

While working at Perspecta as a Desktop Support Analyst, I received a call from a senior medical staff member who was frustrated because her email encryption system wasn’t working, and she couldn’t send patient data securely.
After troubleshooting, I found that the issue was due to a missing S/MIME certificate that had not been properly installed on her system. Rather than just installing it for her, I took the time to explain that S/MIME acts like a digital envelope — it both verifies the sender and ensures that the email is encrypted end-to-end.
I avoided technical jargon and related it to physical mail: I explained it as sealing a letter and signing it so only the intended recipient could open it. She really appreciated the clear explanation and said it helped her feel more confident using secure systems.
That moment reminded me how critical it is in IT — especially in a healthcare environment — to communicate clearly and build trust with users who rely on secure technologies but may not understand how they work.


> 5. Tell me about a time you had to prioritize multiple tasks under a tight deadline.”

Example (Perspecta – Remote):

As a Remote Desktop Support Analyst with Perspecta, I frequently received simultaneous service tickets from users across the Defense Health Agency. One morning, I was assigned three high-priority issues at once: a command-level account lockout, a remote printer install at a clinic, and a critical user reporting application access failure during a telehealth session.

I prioritized based on user impact. I immediately addressed the command-level lockout, restored access through Active Directory, then initiated remote session support to resolve the telehealth issue. Finally, I scheduled the printer install and guided the clinic staff through the setup remotely.

I maintained clear ticket documentation and communicated ETAs to each user. All tasks were resolved within SLA, and I was commended for keeping things moving under pressure — which reaffirmed how remote support relies on both triage skills and effective communication.


> 6. Describe a time you received constructive criticism. How did you respond?”

Example (Perspecta – Documentation):

While working remotely for Perspecta, I once submitted a support ticket note with minimal detail after resolving a VPN access issue. My team lead followed up and advised me to include clearer remediation steps for visibility across shifts.

I appreciated the feedback and immediately adjusted my documentation process. I created a personal template for logging resolution steps, command outputs, and user communications in ticket histories.

It not only improved my workflow, but also helped other analysts pick up where I left off. That experience showed me how even small process improvements can have team-wide impact — especially in a remote support model.


> 7. Tell me about a time you had to work with a difficult teammate or customer.”

Example (Perspecta – Remote User Support):

One of the remote clinic administrators I supported was regularly frustrated with connection issues and didn’t feel comfortable using remote support tools. During one session, she became impatient and demanded an immediate resolution without following the standard troubleshooting process.

I stayed calm, acknowledged her frustration, and reframed the situation by walking her through a step-by-step approach, explaining each fix along the way. I also followed up with a short, non-technical guide I created for future reference.

Over time, she became more comfortable with the process and even asked for me by name in follow-up requests. It reinforced that empathy and clear communication are just as important as technical skills when working with remote users.

> 8. Tell me about a time you had to take initiative.

Example (BEAT LLC – Siphon Adoption):

While working as a Cyber Engineer supporting PPSM at BEAT LLC, our team was in the early stages of transitioning to a new system called Siphon for managing ports, protocols, and services across DHA systems. The rollout came with limited documentation and several workflow gaps that made it difficult for users to adapt.

I took the initiative to thoroughly explore the new platform, test different request scenarios, and document both technical steps and user experience challenges. I created a detailed SOP and feedback notes outlining problem areas, common user errors, and suggestions for improvement.

I shared these materials with my team and leadership, and they were later incorporated into team-wide onboarding resources. This not only improved our team’s efficiency but also helped reduce errors for clients submitting PPSM requests.

Taking the lead in documenting and simplifying the Siphon onboarding process made a measurable difference, and it highlighted how proactive knowledge-sharing can ease transitions in evolving security environments."

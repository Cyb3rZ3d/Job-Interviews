<br>

**Interviewer:** Thanks for taking the time to speak with us today. Let’s start with a quick introduction.


***My Response*** Thank you Ava for the opportunity to speak with you today.

<br><br>


> **1. Can you tell me a bit about yourself and what drew you to cybersecurity, particularly this opportunity with Dark Wolf Solutions?**


I'm a cybersecurity professional with over 5 years of experience supporting the Department of Defense in roles ranging from Cyber Engineer to Help Desk and Desktop Support. I currently hold CASP+, CySA+, PenTest+, and Security+ CompTIA certifications, and I’m pursuing my M.S. in Cybersecurity at Texas A&M University–San Antonio, with graduation expected in December 2025.

My interest in cybersecurity began during my service in the U.S. Navy, where I was exposed to mission-critical systems that demanded high levels of operational security. That foundation evolved into a passion for protecting infrastructure, which I’ve further developed through hands-on experience with vulnerability management, risk assessments using SimpleRisk, cloud-based system engineering with AWS and GCP, and SOC configuration using ELK Stack. I’ve also participated in red team operations, performing penetration testing and analyzing attack surfaces — skills I’m eager to build on in a professional analyst role.

> **2. This is a Junior Security Analyst position. What experience do you have working with SIEM tools or analyzing logs? Can you walk me through an example of detecting or analyzing suspicious activity?**


In my recent CSEC 5350 course at Texas A&M University–San Antonio, I deployed a Syslog server to collect logs from multiple systems and configured it to forward those logs to an ELK Stack setup with Kibana for real-time visualization.

I simulated several attack scenarios, including Apache Path Traversal and Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploits. By analyzing the logs in Kibana, I identified patterns such as repeated failed access attempts followed by anomalous behavior — which aligned with the simulated attack signatures. This gave me direct experience correlating logs and interpreting indicators of compromise, which sharpened my skills in log triage and detection.

Professionally, while working at BEAT LLC, I supported the Defense Health Agency’s cybersecurity compliance efforts by validating Ports, Protocols, and Services Management (PPSM) requests, ensuring they matched authorized configurations in eMASS. While not a direct SIEM task, this work deepened my understanding of secure network architecture and reinforced the importance of log sources and control validation across systems.

> **3. What’s the difference between encryption, hashing, and encoding? When would you use each?**

Encoding - Used to format data for same transmission and storage.  Not for security

    - Ex. Base64 encoding is commonly used to send binary data through that only handle text, i.e.. email.  

Hashing - Used for integrity.
    
    - It is a one-way function that converts input into a fixed-length string of character.  

Encryption - Used for confidentiality.

    -  It requires a key to both encrypt and decrypt the data. 
        
        - Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both, while

        - Asymmetric encryption uses a public/private key pair. 
        
        For example, HTTPS uses encryption to secure web traffic, and S/MIME uses asymmetric encryption to secure email communications.

> **4. Imagine you receive a high-priority alert from the SIEM system at 3 a.m. What steps would you take to triage and respond to it?**

If I receive a high-priority alert, the first step is to triage the incident by reviewing the alert details — such as the type of threat, source/destination IPs, timestamps, and the affected system. I’d correlate this information with logs in the SIEM, like Kibana in my ELK Stack lab, to determine if it’s a false positive or a true incident.

If it’s valid, I’d follow the incident response process:

    - Contain the threat — for example, by isolating the affected host or blocking malicious IPs via firewall rules.

    - Analyze the scope — check if lateral movement or privilege escalation occurred.

    - Document all findings and actions in the incident tracking system.

    - Notify appropriate stakeholders, following escalation protocols.

    - Once contained, I’d support eradication and recovery by removing malware, applying patches, or restoring clean backups.

Finally, I’d participate in the post-incident review to help identify gaps in detection or response procedures.

I’ve applied a similar approach in red/blue team projects — like when I detected a simulated Apache RCE attack in my SOC lab — and I understand how critical it is to act quickly but methodically."

> **5. How do you stay current with the latest cybersecurity threats, tools, or trends?**

I stay current through a mix of hands-on labs, industry reading, and formal coursework. I’m currently pursuing my M.S. in Cybersecurity, which keeps me updated on emerging topics like quantum cryptography and cloud security. Outside of class, I train regularly on platforms like Hack The Box — for example, completing their SOC Analyst path to sharpen my detection and investigation skills using real-world attack scenarios.

I also follow trusted sources like:
    - CISA alerts,and 
    - The Hacker News, 
    - SANS Blogs, Information Security White papers, SANS Newsletters. 
    
    - For threat intelligence, 
        - I check MITRE ATT&CK. 
        
    - On the tooling side, 
    
        - I’ve been experimenting with open-source solutions and cloud solutions while still refining my skills on core tools like kali linux, metasploit, ELK, OpenVAS, and Burp Suite.


I also enjoy sharing what I learn by contributing to my GitHub repo, which includes lab notes and red/blue/purple team projects from class and training.

> **6. Tell me about a time you worked on a team to solve a technical problem. What was the challenge, and what role did you play?**

Situation: While serving as an Aviation Machinist Mate in the U.S. Navy, I was part of a maintenance crew responsible for keeping F/A-18 Super Hornets flight-ready. During one deployment, an aircraft scheduled for a critical flight operation began reporting engine vibration issues.

Task: Our job was to quickly identify and resolve the issue so the aircraft could safely complete its mission on time. Delays weren’t an option due to the high operational tempo.

Action: Working closely with my team, I helped conduct a full diagnostic inspection of the engine system. We identified the issue as an improperly seated bearing in the turbine section. I assisted with disassembly, properly installed the replacement, verified torque specifications, and coordinated with Quality Assurance to complete final checks.

Result: We resolved the issue quickly and safely, returning the aircraft to full operational status. That experience reinforced the importance of structured teamwork, attention to detail, and working under pressure — all of which translate well into cybersecurity, especially when responding to incidents or collaborating on forensic investigations.

> **7. This role supports DoD and federal missions. How familiar are you with compliance frameworks like NIST 800-53, RMF, or FedRAMP?**

While I haven’t yet had the opportunity to implement NIST 800-53, RMF, or FedRAMP directly in a professional setting, I’m familiar with each framework through my academic training, independent research, and hands-on cybersecurity labs.

I understand that NIST 800-53 provides a comprehensive catalog of controls that support confidentiality, integrity, and availability for federal systems. I’ve reviewed these control families as part of my master’s-level coursework and explored how they align with system categorization and control selection under the Risk Management Framework (RMF).

I’m also familiar with STIGs (Security Technical Implementation Guides) and how they are used to enforce secure configurations for operating systems, applications, and network devices in DoD environments. I’ve referenced DISA STIGs when hardening systems during lab work and recognize their critical role in maintaining baseline compliance and audit readiness.

In one course, I used SimpleRisk to perform risk assessments on cloud-based systems, and while I haven’t worked directly with FedRAMP, I understand it governs cloud service provider authorization for federal use.

I regularly refer to NIST publications, and DISA STIG portal to stay up to date on control requirements and implementation guidance. 

With not much direct professional expereince, I’m confident that I can quickly apply these frameworks and tools in a real-world setting with support from senior analysts.
